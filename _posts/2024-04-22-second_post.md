# Creating a Visually Pleasing GUI

Follow some of these neat tips next time you need to construct a GUI (tkinter), for a project.

The First step when I like to create a GUI, espically one which needs to load in files, is a cascading drop down menu. This works well as it does not crowd the main frame of the GUI with extra buttons. A drop down menu for loading files typically contains an open file, save file and exit tab.
