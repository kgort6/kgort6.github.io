# Creating a Visually Pleasing GUI

Follow some of these neat tips next time you need to construct a GUI (tkinter), for a project.

The first tip, when I like to create a GUI, espically one which needs to load in files, is a cascading drop down menu. This works well as it does not crowd the main frame of the GUI with extra buttons. A drop down menu for loading files typically contains an open file, save file and exit tab.

The next tip will be using the space in the main frame effectively, try to group buttons that have revelance with each other together and put them under a revelant label, also guive each section a different colour. This colour can be revelant to what the topic, but the main reason is so the sections are differiated enough. Therefore choose colours that have noticable diffference to user. 

Third Tip if possible try to implement more then just label and buttons. Experiment and try to use the more out there tools, Tools such as check buttons, scroll bar widgets and list box widgets are some of my favourite to use and will allow your GUI to stand out compared to other GUIs

The final tip, if you are making your GUI for consumption by the user, have features in the the GUI to allow for customization. My Favouriate would be the addition of a colour wheel to be able to change the them of the GUI, so if the default colours that were used for buttons etc were not to the liking of a user they could use the colour wheel to choose any other colour of their desire.
